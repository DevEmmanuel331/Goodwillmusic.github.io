                    <p> The Ghana Education Service (GES) announced that the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) will release
                        the provisional results for the 2024 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in the second
                        week of December 2024. This was conveyed in a press release issued on December 1, 2024. According to the release,
                        WAEC has completed marking the scripts for students who took the 2024 WASSCE for School Candidates and is now 
                        finalizing the process to release the results between December 9 and December 15, 2024. Speaking to Accra-based
                        Citi FM, WAEC's Head of Public Affairs confirmed, "We are looking at the second week of December, so at least between 
                        the 9th and the 15th of December, we are sure that we will be able to release the results." 

The 2024 WASSCE was held across Ghana from August 5 to September 20, 2024, with Visual Arts Project Work concluding the exams. This year, 460,611 candidates, including 212,954 males and 247,657 females, took the exams at 1,000 centers nationwide, with 1,003 representing private schools. WAEC has withheld 19,808 candidates' results due to malpractice issues, with some results canceled entirely following investigations. In its statement, WAEC reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the exam's integrity and urged affected candidates to seek clarification. "All 2024 WASSCE candidates are encouraged to contact WAEC's WhatsApp assistant service at +233 20 555 0989 to check the status of their results if withheld or canceled," the statement noted. Candidates can also appeal through WAEC offices. GES and WAEC assured the public of their dedication to fairness and transparency in the examination process. With over 460,000 candidates awaiting their results, 
                        this announcement marks a significant milestone in the academic journey of Ghanaian students.</p>
